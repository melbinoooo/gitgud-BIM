# The Idea:

Being a newcomer to the BIM industry is both a thrilling and daunting experience. And you can bet that on the same day and time next year, someone will be just like me, unsure of where to begin laying the necessary BIM foundation.

I've only lately begun keeping a personal journal, and it's remarkable how going over what I did and how my day went helps me organize my thoughts in detail.

So, why not apply the same logic to my work, career, or study, as the case may be. I'll simply make it a public repository. If someone else finds it useful in the future, that's OK; this is meant to be found, this is my tailored approach to becoming effective in this field.

# The Goal:

The goal for this running library is to build an understanding on how Information / Data move in the AEC industry. 

Build a relative set of skills which will I be able to selectively produce, list, modify, script, automate, generate, and manage information models.

# Targets:

- [ ]  ISO-19650
    - A thorough understanding of BIM Framework
        - How â†’ Interpret the ISO-19650 parts as layman as I possibly can.
- [ ]  Python / RevitPythonShell
    - Ability to type-communicate with applications other than Revit.
        - How â†’ Build Micro-Games or Apps, with the intention of having a fundamental understanding with the python language.
        And slowly apply the learnings to a python-abled BIM softwares like Revit.
- [ ]  Dynamo
    - Visual Programming â†’Create Scripts, Automate, Generate.
        - It's not just about being fast; it's also about being smart with the tasks.
- [ ]  DesignScript
    - Flexibility with Dynamo.
        - Customize those nodes!

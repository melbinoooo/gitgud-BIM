# PART 1
# Variables = A Container of Values (Data).
# In this example; both (a) and (b) are variables who contains a typed-value of its own.


a = 5
b = 100
print(a,b)

# a is a variable that contains a value of 5.
# b is also a variable that contains a value of 100.

#----------------------------------------#

# PART 2
# Variables also respects on how you order your variables.
# In this case, you will see that our variable "c" will only use the latest typed down value.

c = 200
c = 100
print(c)

#----------------------------------------#

# PART 3
# In Variables, we can use letters from (a-z), numbers from (0-9), or an underscore (_).
# In this example we will use a word as a variable to contain a fixed value called literals.

Android_name = 101021
print(Android_name)

# The word "Android_name" has a literal value of "101021", which means if we print out "Android_name" it will give us "101021"
# We can also use words variable to represent another word value of its own.
# However, In the case of letter values or a composition of both letter and numerical values, it is required to put it inside of a (" ") or (' ') for example:

first_name = "Bino"
print(first_name)

last_name = "Bino123"
print(last_name)

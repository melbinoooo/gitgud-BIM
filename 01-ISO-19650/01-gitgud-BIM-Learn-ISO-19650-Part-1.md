# To-do

Read ISO-19650

- [ ]  **Part 1 - Concepts & Principles**
    - [x]  Who participates
    - [x]  8 General Steps
    - [x]  The Information Delivery Cycle
    - [x]  Information Requirements
    - [ ]  Collaborative Information Environment
        - [ ]  CDE (Common Data Environment)
    - [ ]  Use of Metadata
    - [ ]  Organization of Information

## The goal is to understand the BIM Framework.

*Framework = an essential structure to support a working system.*

## What is ISO-19650?

- It outlines the concept and principles of BIM.
- A framework for an efficient project delivery.
- A defined request and creation of information needed by the client.
- The ISO-19650 is applicable to all assets inside the project.
- A Global Standard for BIM Management.
- The WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, HOW of Information management during the delivery phase of assets.

## THE WHO?

1. **Appointing Party**
    1. The one who will receive the information at the end.
    2. e.g. Owner, Client.
    3. But not limited to letter b‚Äôs categorization.
    
2. **Lead Appointed Party**
    1. The one, group, team, org that won the bidding of the owner‚Äôs project.
    2. Could be a single entity, could be multiple.
    3. The direct connection between the owner and the ‚Äúprovider‚Äù of information.
    
3. **Appointed Party**
    1. The team led by the Lead Appointed party.
    2. The provider of information.
    3. The delivery team(s), task team(s).

1. **Type of Teams**
    1. Project Team
        1. Every one who is involved.
    2. Delivery Team
        1. The Lead Appointed & Its Tasks team(s).
            1. e.g. General Contractor ‚Üí Sub contractors.
            2. e.g. Lead Engineer ‚Üí MEP Modelers.
    3. Tasks Team
        1. An individual / Group who are responsible to a certain information models.
            1. e.g. Modelers.

## 8 GENERAL STEPS OF BIM

Information Management during the delivery phase of assets.

1. **Assessment and Needs**
    1. Owners will determine what BIM services they need for their project.
    
2. **Initiation/Invitation to Tender**
    1. Based on what the owner needs, they will now send out a bidding request.

3. **Tender Response**
    1. Based on what the Invitation to Tender details is, we write out a proposal on how are we going to approach the requirements.
    
4. **Appointment**
    1. Once we, or a specific BIM company is selected, the company will now prepare a detailed timeline and milestones to accomplished the requirement of the project, which then will be announced to the owner and the team.
    
5. **Mobilization**
    1. The lead appointed party (the one who wins the bidding), will now delegate a detailed tasks to its organization.
    2. and appoint and internal team which will be doing the specific tasks as required.
    
6. **Collaborative Production and Information**
    1. the appointed team must and should collaborate within its own layer of structured working environment.
        1. Manager ‚Üí Modeler ‚Üí Checker ‚Üí Revisions ‚Üí Approval ‚Üí Archiving. 
        
7. **Information Model Delivery**
    1. The Appointing Party (a.k.a Owner) will review the published information models if it qualifies based on the asking set of requirements.
    2. The owner will then decide if the Information Models were approved or rejected.
    
8. **Project Close-Out & Asset Information Model (AIM) Aggregation**
    1. Once the assets are approved, and all the required set of requirements are met.
    2. The Information will now be then archived and aggregated into the ***asset information model***, for the on going operation and maintenance of the assets.

## **Overview of The Information Delivery Cycle**

   - ***1ST*** - THE APPOINTING PARTY (client, owner, others)
      - Will Produce a list(s) or statement(s) of need, stating an assurance of information requirements.
      - Will define how the concepts and principles of infomration management are going to be implemented and lists of the benefits to be expected.
      - Will confirms the types of information and request a clarification on how the "different types" of information will be structured and be exchanged.
      - IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE CLIENT (APPOINTING PARTY) TO EXPLAIN THE PRINCIPAL REASONS WHY BIM IS REQUIRED. As it will greatly help give an additional context to the project delivery team(s) later on.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

  - ***2ND*** - Prospective LEAD PARTY (contractor, designer, architect, others.)
    - Will respond to the Appointing Party's Information requirements through their (pre-appointment) BIM execution plan, which includes their list(s) or statement(s) of capability and capacity to apply the ISO 19650 series.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

-   ***3RD*** - Appointment
    -   The Appointing Party (client) will consider the contents of all BIM Execution Plan submitted by the Lead Appointed Party or Parties.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

-   ***4TH*** - Mobilization & Collaborative Production
    -   During the mobilization: The Appointing Party, The Lead Appointed Party or Parties and each of their own internal Appointed Party/Parties, will collaborate to agree on Key roles and Responsibilities and to agree to an ***Information Delivery Plan*** in the form of the *[following list]*, that will  outlines coordination and delivery procedures.
        -   1. BIM Execution Plan
        -   2. The Master Information Delivery Plan
        -   3. Task Information Delivery Plans  
    - Briefings and Training will also be required to ensure everyone has an agreed level of competency and understanding about the project requirements.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

-   ***5TH*** - Information Delivery
    -   All Parties involved to the production of the information models will  establish the level of information required AT ***every project stage*** and approval.
    -   These made Information systems will provide and consider the needs of the project team and stakeholders.
    -   These made information systems will also entails the selection and use of appropriate technologies required for each delivery phases or in totality.
    -   At the end of every project stage, assurance will be provided that the information requirements have been met appropriately.
        -   This will be done through manual and automated methods.
        -   The Relevant Asset Informations will be handed over at completion to inform the operation and maintenance.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## **PIM (Project Information Model) // *The Specific Requirements***

- A specific Model Information required by the Appointing Party (Owner)
- Could be in a form of: 3D Models, databases, spreadsheets and other documentation materials.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## **AIM (Asset Information Model) // *The Overall Requirements***

- The Final Output of the BIM Process.
- Provides all information required to perform the AEC Operations.
- AIM can include: Graphical Models, non-graphical data, necessary documentations.
    - unnecessary data = put to achieved.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## ***Four Key Documents that establishes the Appointing Party's Information Requirements***
-   **OIR** - ORGANIZATIONAL Information Requirements
    -   Relations to organizational objectives.
-   **PIR** - PROJECT Information Requirements
    -   Relations to Purpose, Design and Construction of assets.
-   **AIR** - ASSET Information Requirements
    -   Relations to the operation and maintenance of an asset/s.
-   **EIR** - EXCHANGE Information Requirements
    -   Relations to an appointment.

# PART 1
# Input and Output: using [print()]
# Do you have any experience with Microsoft Excel? It's basically like that.
# Users (you), can input a certain value and the program will give back an output.
# The most common output command is the "print()", for example:

first_name = "Bino"
birth_month = "October"
print(first_name, birth_month)

# Output = Bino, October
# Using print command we can call up what's inside the variable of the "first_name" and "birth_month"

# Another example

song_name = "Champagne Supernova"
year_released = 1996
print(song_name, year_released)
# Output = Champagne Supernova, 1996

# PART 2
# Input and Output using [input()]
# The difference between the print and the input command is that the input takes a literal input which came from a user.

user_name = input("Enter Username Here: ")
print("Welcome", user_name)

# Output prompt = Enter Username Here: (you can type here).
# Output = Welcome (whichever you typed).
